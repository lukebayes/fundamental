h3. Introduction

Fundamental is intended to be a basic, starter Rails application. The idea is heavily inspired by the "Bort":http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort project.

The main features that this project hopes to support are as follows:
 * RESTful user accounts with role based authorization
 * OpenID authentication
 * Image upload, manipulation and retrieval
 * Rich text user input
 * Asynchronous message queue
 * Full administrative tools

Support for the following external services:
 * Instant deployment to http://heroku.com
 * Support for http://runcoderun.com continuous integration service
 * Support Amazon Web Services wherever possible
