h3. Introduction

Fundamental is intended to be a basic, starter Rails application. The idea is heavily inspired by the "Bort":http://github.com/fudgestudios/bort project.

The main features that this project hopes to support are as follows:
 * RESTful user accounts with role based authorization
 * OpenID user authentication
 * Google apps (or GMail) SMTP Servers
 * Image upload, manipulation and retrieval
 * Full administrative tools, for provided features

Support for the following external services:
 * "Heroku":http://heroku.com for deployment
 * "Run Code Run":http://runcoderun.com continuous integration service
 * "Amazon Web Services":http://aws.amazon.com for image upload and asset host
